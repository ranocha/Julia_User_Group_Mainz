# Leveraging the Julia infrastructure on GitHub for package development
In this short seminar we will discuss how to leverage the Julia infrastructure on GitHub for package development. We will cover the following topics:
- **How to create a new package**
- **How to add tests to the package**
- **How to add documentation to the package**
- **How to setup a Zenodo repository for the package**

And most importantly: **How to use the GitHub Actions to automate the testing and documentation of the package**.
Note that this seminar is only a brief introduction to the topic and to best of my knowledge. Here, I want to provide you with some templates you can use in your own packages. In general, the Julia community heavily relies on these things and if you browes GitHub, you will find many examples where you can copy & pasted things to your own package.
A good starting point are: the [SciML organisation](https://github.com/sciml), [Trixi.jl](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi.jl) (developed by Hendrik) or [JustRelax.jl](https://github.com/PTSolvers/JustRelax.jl)

(Julia version 1.11.2 - 09.01.2025)
